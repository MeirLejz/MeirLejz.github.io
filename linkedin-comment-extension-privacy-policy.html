Privacy Policy for LinkedIn Comment Assistant
Last Updated: March 9, 2025

LinkedIn Comment Assistant is a Chrome extension that helps users generate comments for LinkedIn posts using artificial intelligence. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data when you use the extension.

1. Data We Collect
We collect the following data when you use the extension:
- The content of the LinkedIn post nearest to the comment section where you click the "Generate Comment" button.
- The comment style you select (e.g., formal, casual) to customize the generated comment.

This data is only collected when you actively choose to generate a comment.

2. How We Use Your Data
The collected post content and selected style are sent to our backend server at https://linkedin-comment-assistant-c78fcd89d8ae.herokuapp.com/. The backend uses this information to create a prompt, which is submitted to the Open AI API to generate a comment. The generated comment is then returned to you through the extension. We do not use your data for any other purpose beyond providing this functionality.

3. Data Sharing
To generate comments, we share the post content and style with:
- Our backend server, hosted on Heroku, which processes your request.
- Open AI, a third-party AI service provider that generates the comment. For details on how Open AI handles data, see their Privacy Policy at https://openai.com/policies/privacy.

We do not share your data with any other third parties.

4. Data Storage and Security
We do not store the post content or style on our backend server after the comment is generated. The data is processed temporarily during your request and discarded once the response is sent back to the extension. All data transmission between your browser, our backend, and Open AI occurs over HTTPS, ensuring it is encrypted in transit.

5. Your Rights
Since we do not retain your data after processing, we do not store any personal information that requires access, modification, or deletion. If you have questions or concerns about your data, please contact us.

6. Contact Us
For questions about this Privacy Policy or the extension, please email us at meirlejzerowicz@gmail.com.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy as needed. The latest version will always be available at this URL: [https://meirlejz.github.io/linkedin-comment-extension-privacy-policy.html].
